# Coffee Shop Analysis

### Background

I am completing a project for my Data Analysis portfolio and I chose transaction records from Maven Analytics sample dataset- 'Maven Roasters', a fictitious coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. Dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp and location, along with product-level details. Here, I will be role playing a data analyst for Maven Roasters to help answer some of their business questions.

### Business Task

The company is interested to see the compnay's overall sales of 2023 with the following questions analyzed in the report.

1. How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?

2. Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?

3. Which products are sold most and least often? Which drive the most revenue for the business?
