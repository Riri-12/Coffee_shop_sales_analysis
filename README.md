# Coffee Shop Analysis

### Background

I am completing a project for my Data Analysis portfolio and I chose transaction records from Maven Analytics sample dataset- 'Maven Roasters', a fictitious coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. Dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp and location, along with product-level details. Here, I will be role playing a data analyst for Maven Roasters to help answer some of their business questions.

### Business Task

The company is interested to see the compnay's overall sales of 2023 with the following questions analyzed in the report.

1. How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?

2. Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?

3. Which products are sold most and least often? Which drive the most revenue for the business?


### Data Sources

The data was extracted from Maven analytics sample datasets [Link here](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?dataStructure=5wfxyeVf1etbP4TXdyPdG1&page=1&pageSize=5) Licsense is Public domain.

### Data Analysis

The data was analysed using Excel, Mysql server and visualized in Tableau public. 

I used Excel, MySQL server to clean and prepare the data for data analysis.  

### Tools
- Excel- data cleaning
- My SQL server- data cleaning and analysis
- Tableau public - Visualization


### Findings

- Sales droppped in January and slowly started increasing from February until June. May and June were the highest sales month. The sales drop in January could have been due to the cold weather and after holidays.

- Summer months appeared to have more sales compared to the winter months which could have been because of the warm weather and longer day


### Recommendations

- Implementing online ordering and delivery services to increase the sales that are hit due to the cold weather

- Implementing marketing strategies as running promotional capmpaigns that highlight seasonal products, discounts, and events such as collaborating with local business to increase the sales.

- Introducing loyalty programs during the slower sale months such as on January to attract the customers


  The visualization findings were completed in Tableau public [link here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Coffee_shop_sales_2023/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
